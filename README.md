# üìä Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project focuses on analyzing customer sentiment from Flipkart reviews using a range of machine learning and deep learning models. It provides a comparative analysis of different approaches including Na√Øve Bayes, Lexicon-based method, Linear SVM, and BERT to determine the most effective model for sentiment classification.

## üîç Overview
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate multiple sentiment analysis models to classify Flipkart product reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. It combines both traditional ML techniques and cutting-edge NLP approaches to provide a well-rounded comparison.
